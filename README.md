Submitted by: **Yaw Kessey-Ankomah**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

        A problem that I encountered was understanding the purpose of each language and their respective roles. After implementing the “guess” and lighting up a                button function
        a) I could not see the yellow and pink buttons light up 
        b) I was unable to see the user’s guess in the console. 
         At first, I had thought, the two issues were directly aligned with each other but then I went back to understand the purposes of the three languages used              in this prework. Expanding my knowledge on the purpose of these languages allowed me to quickly spot out where the problem in my code was located. After                doing so, I realized that issue "a" was located in my CSS file and issue "b" was located in my JavaScript file. 


3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
   
   A couple of questions that I have are: 
        a) If I could complete this project without react js or the other technologies, what are the purposes for them? 
        b) Would I be able to open this game on any browser or even on my mobile device. Would I have to write different code to account for the sizes of other                 devices? 
        c) How would I go about giving other people access to my website?
        d) A search engine like Google is their code for each page. How would the computer know to color links or to separate links from body text or header texts.


4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
    
    While completing the prework, I noticed how this game, in a sense, resembles music interval ear training. Musical interval ear training is an exercise in which     you are played two musical notes in a sequence, and your goal is to identify the space/interval between the two notes. The light and sound game doesn’t             necessarily have equal spacing between the sounds of each button, but I could implement more controls to cover the different pitches on a scale. In the end, I       would have created a helpful tool for musicians, including myself, that would aid me in identifying pitches intervals, making better judgments in music, and         increasing my ability to hear and identify specific musical notes.
